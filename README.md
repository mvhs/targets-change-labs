## Change Mini Labs ##

This assignment consists of two mini labs that involve change. This template can be downloaded with the `mvhs` teacher ID and `change-labs` assignment ID. Both labs should be submitted together.

#### Lab 1: `JarChange` ####

Write `JarChange.java`. The main method should provide an interface similar to the output below. It should accept numbers of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies as input (in that order) and should output a phrase in the form `x dollars and y cents`. The automated tests are merely a sanity check. You should manually test your code prior to submission.

Example Output:

    Enter the number of quarters: 10
    Enter the number of dimes: 5
    Enter the number of nickels: 4
    Enter the number of pennies: 17
    Total value: 3 dollars and 37 cents.
    

#### Lab 2: `ChangeTendered` ####

Write `ChangeTendered.java`. The main method should provide an interface similar to the output below. It should accept the purchase price and amount paid with as input and output the change provided as shown below. Automated tests are provided for the helper method `calculateChange`. Your interface will not be autograded, but it is still required for credit.

    $98.50
    How much money did you pay with?
